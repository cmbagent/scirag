1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by performing a principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of deviations in the free electron fraction, $x_e(z)$, fitting the amplitudes of these modes to CMB temperature, polarization, lensing, and BAO data; the results show no significant deviations from the standard recombination scenario, confirming its robustness with current data . The analysis also constrains possible non-standard effects, such as energy injection from dark matter annihilation, by quantifying their impact on the ionization history and CMB anisotropies .

The apparent preference for the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$ deviating from its theoretical expectation ($A_L=1$) in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily driven by oscillatory residuals in the high-multipole temperature power spectrum that resemble excess lensing smoothing, with the effect being sensitive to analysis choices, parameter degeneracies, and potentially influenced by residual systematics, statistical fluctuations, or foreground mismodeling .

12,Why are BAO measurements utilised with such significance in Planck papers?,"**Answer**:

BAO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation) measurements are utilized with high significance in Planck papers because they provide robust, independent, and precise constraints on cosmological parameters—such as the Hubble constant, matter density, spatial curvature, and the expansion history—while being largely insensitive to nonlinear astrophysical processes, thereby enabling stringent cross-validation and consistency checks of the base-ΛCDM cosmology inferred from the CMB (aghanim2020planck2018results chunks 25, 26, 27, 3, 30).

The network captures the general trend of SFRD evolution with redshift and enables fast exploration of parameter space, though it cannot reproduce high-frequency variability due to cosmic variance .

In the CAMELS project, the authors prevent overly complicated functions in symbolic regression by assigning a 'complexity' value to each operator (e.g., +, -, ×, ÷ assigned 1; log, exp, a^b assigned 2), and using this complexity as a penalty to discourage the evolution of unnecessarily complex analytic expressions .

60,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?","**Answer**:

The neural network relies much more on $V_{max}$ (maximum circular velocity) than on other dark matter–affected properties because $V_{max}$ is a stable and direct probe of the gravitational potential well and central dark matter content, making it highly sensitive to cosmological parameters like $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, whereas other properties such as total subhalo mass or velocity dispersion are more susceptible to baryonic effects and tidal stripping, thus carrying less robust cosmological information .
