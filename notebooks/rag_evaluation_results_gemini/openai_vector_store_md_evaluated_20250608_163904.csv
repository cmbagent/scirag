1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,semi-blind eigen-analysis (often referred to as a principal-component analysis),"**Answer**:

The standard recombination history in the Planck 2018 analysis is tested using a semi-blind principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of perturbations to the free-electron fraction, x_e(z), across redshifts relevant for recombination. The amplitudes of the first few eigenmodes (eXeMs) are constrained using Planck TT,TE,EE+lowE+lensing+BAO data, and all are found to be consistent with zero, indicating no significant deviation from the standard recombination scenario within the sensitivity of the data【1:3†1807.06209v4.md】.

The apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily due to oscillatory residuals in the high-ℓ CMB power spectra (especially in the range ℓ = 1100–2000) that resemble the effect of increased lensing smoothing, leading to a best-fit value of A_L > 1.

10,How are systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses corrected in the Planck analysis?,The X-ray cluster masses errors are corrected by multiplying the true masses by a “hydrostatic mass bias” factor.,"**Answer**:

Systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses in the Planck analysis are corrected by calibrating the hydrostatic mass bias, often denoted as (1-b), using independent mass estimates from weak gravitational lensing and CMB lensing. The Planck analysis incorporates these calibrations by adopting a prior on the mass bias parameter, with recent studies (e.g., Zubeldia & Challinor 2019) finding (1-b) = 0.71 ± 0.10, and by comparing results with external datasets to ensure consistency and account for systematic uncertainties in the mass calibration process.

The main sources of the differences between the ΛCDM parameters in Planck 2015 and 2018 are: (1) the adoption of a new low-ℓ polarization likelihood (""lowE"") in 2018, which led to a lower and tighter constraint on the optical depth τ, propagating to shifts in other parameters via degeneracies; and (2) corrections to the high-ℓ polarization spectra in 2018, especially beam-leakage and polarization efficiency corrections, which further shifted parameters such as ω_b, n_s, and ω_c.

The neural network of CAMELS can predict the evolution of a cosmological quantity, such as the star formation rate density (SFRD), with the redshift given cosmological and astrophysical parameters with an average precision of about 0.12 dex (for SIMBA) and 0.106 dex (for IllustrisTNG), capturing the general trend well but not the high-frequency variability due to cosmic variance.

60,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?","V_{max} contains more information than M_t and \sigma_{\nu}, which are other properties that are expected to be heavily affected by dark matter. The authors believe that is because it is known that V_{max} correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass, thus the value of V_{max} may remain rather stable since it mostly probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, that are the least affected by processes like tidal forces.","**Answer**:

The neural network uses V_{max} much more than other properties affected by dark matter because V_{max} (the maximum circular velocity) is a more stable and direct proxy for the dark matter content and the depth of the gravitational potential well in the central regions of galaxies, which are less affected by processes like tidal stripping than total subhalo mass or velocity dispersion. This makes V_{max} more robustly correlated with cosmological parameters like Ω_m, allowing the network to extract more reliable information from it compared to other dark matter-related properties that can be more easily altered by astrophysical processes or environmental effects【1:1†2201.02202v1.md】.

The apparent magnitude of the reference SN Ia in the HST paper is determined by a simultaneous fit to all Cepheid and SN Ia data, where the SN Ia magnitudes in the calibrator sample are expressed as m_{x, i}^{0} = (μ_{0, i} - μ_{0, N4258}) + m_{x, N4258}^{0}.

79,Which anchor distances had problems with being used as anchors in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper?,The distance to M31 had problems with being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0.,"**Answer**:

The HST paper identifies that the use of M31 as an anchor in the determination of H_0 has problems due to the lack of F555W filter and time-series data in the PHAT HST program, making it difficult to use the same dereddening procedure as for other anchors. Additionally, the DEB distances in M31 are based only on early-type stars, which have significant systematic uncertainties due to non-LTE stellar model atmospheres, so M31 was conservatively removed from the primary anchor set, though its value is consistent with the others. The LMC early-type DEBs are also considered less reliable than late-type DEBs for similar reasons, but the late-type DEBs are used for the LMC anchor in the main analysis.

M31 has problems being used as an anchor in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper primarily because the HST PHAT program did not use the F555W filter or include time-series data, making it impossible to use the same individual, mean-light F555W-F814W colors to deredden the Cepheids in F160W as for other SH0ES galaxies. Additionally, the DEB distances for M31 are based only on early-type stars, which require non-LTE stellar model atmospheres and introduce systematic uncertainties that are hard to assess, unlike the more reliable late-type DEBs available for the LMC; thus, M31 is not used as a primary anchor until these issues are resolved or improved measurements are available.

90,"In the ACT DR6 paper, how are models that alter late-time growth of the universe handled in modeling non-linear corrections to the matter power spectrum?",Custom alternatives to HMcode are used or restrictions to linear scales are made.,"**Answer**:

In the ACT DR6 paper, for models that alter the late-time growth of the universe (such as those with a modified growth index γ), non-linear corrections to the matter power spectrum are handled by using a modified version of the camb code, as released by Nguyen et al. (2023), which self-consistently modifies the CMB lensing potential and other late-time observables, but leaves the unlensed primary CMB perturbations unchanged. This approach ensures that the non-linear modeling is consistent with the altered growth history, and the theoretical calculations for these models are performed with this modified camb implementation .

According to the ACT DR6 paper, allowing both the electron mass and spatial curvature to vary at recombination does open up degeneracies that permit higher values of H_0 in fits to CMB and BAO data, but this model does not yield a significant improvement in fit over ΛCDM, and the inclusion of SNIa data pulls the results back toward ΛCDM values, disfavoring this approach as a solution to the H_0 discrepancy.

104,Do the extensions to \lambdaCDM considered in the ACT DR6 paper help to resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H_0 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement?,No. The range of H_0 given by the models studied in the ACT DR6 paper is still lower than the 2024 SH0ES measurement of H_0.,"**Answer**:

The ACT DR6 paper finds that the extensions to ΛCDM considered—including varying the effective number of relativistic species (N_eff), early dark energy (EDE), and phenomenological models with varying fundamental constants—do not resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H_0 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement. Specifically, ACT DR6 prefers N_eff values below the Standard Model expectation, which would lower H_0, and finds no significant preference for EDE or other extensions that would raise H_0 to the SH0ES value; only non-physical models (e.g., varying electron mass and curvature) can accommodate higher H_0, but these are not physically motivated and are disfavored when including SNIa data【0:0†2503.14454v1.md】【0:1†2503.14454v1.md】.
