1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by comparing precise measurements of the CMB temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectra to theoretical predictions, and by performing a principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of perturbations to the free-electron fraction, $x_e(z)$; all results show no significant deviations from the standard recombination scenario and confirm the robustness of cosmological parameter estimates .

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The apparent preference for the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$ deviating from the theoretical expectation of unity in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily driven by oscillatory residuals in the high-multipole temperature power spectrum, which resemble the effect of increased lensing smoothing, and is further influenced by analysis choices, parameter degeneracies, and possible statistical fluctuations or unaccounted-for systematics in the polarization data (aghanim2020planck2018results chunks 10, 39, 40, 41). The effect is not robust, as it is sensitive to the construction of the likelihood and changes with analysis methodology, and is not corroborated by direct lensing reconstruction (aghanim2020planck2018results chunks 10, 38, 39).

16,What are the sources of the differences between the \lambdaCDM parameters between Planck 2015 and 2018?,"**Answer**:

The differences between the ΛCDM parameters in Planck 2015 and 2018 are primarily due to the adoption of a new low-ℓ polarization likelihood using HFI data, which led to a lower and tighter constraint on the optical depth to reionization (τ), and to corrections for systematic effects in high-ℓ polarization spectra, such as beam-leakage and polarization efficiency, as well as changes in foreground modeling and noise estimation methods . These updates resulted in shifts and tighter constraints for several cosmological parameters, including τ, ln(10^10 A_s), ω_b, ω_c, and n_s .

60,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?","**Answer**:

The neural network preferentially uses \( V_{\max} \) because it is a robust tracer of the central dark matter potential, less affected by baryonic effects and tidal stripping than other properties, and thus retains more direct and stable cosmological information, particularly about \( \Omega_m \) . Removing \( V_{\max} \) from the input drastically reduces the network's ability to infer cosmological parameters, underscoring its critical role .

In the ACT DR6 paper, models that alter late-time growth—such as those with dark matter–dark energy interactions or axion-like dark matter—are handled by employing modified halo models or custom approaches, as standard non-linear corrections (e.g., HMcode) are insufficient; in some cases, analyses are restricted to linear scales or use emulators to ensure validity, and a full nonlinear correction model for these scenarios is not yet implemented in the results presented .
