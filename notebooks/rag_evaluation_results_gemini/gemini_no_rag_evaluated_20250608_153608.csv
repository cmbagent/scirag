88,How do the authors of the ACT DR6 paper handle the tension between the local and global values of H_0 determined?,"**Answer**:

They explore extended cosmological models, including those with additional relativistic species or varying dark energy, but find no significant evidence for deviations from ΛCDM [5].

5",No. The range of H_0 given by the models studied in the ACT DR6 paper is still lower than the 2024 SH0ES measurement of H_0.,65.94966173171997,True,,Gemini,100,"The generated answer correctly states that the extended cosmological models considered in the ACT DR6 analysis do not resolve the Hubble tension. This is the same core conclusion as the ideal answer, which states ""No"". The phrasing ""do not fully resolve"" is synonymous with ""do not resolve"" in this scientific context, as any remaining statistically significant tension means the problem is unresolved. The answer is factually correct and captures the main point of the ideal answer.",True,,8.8957200050354
105,"What is the CMB monopole temperature at the 68% CL, according to the P-ACT-LB dataset?","**Answer**:

The CMB monopole temperature, as constrained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 combined with Planck data, is 2.7255 +/- 0.0006 K at 68% CL [5]. This measurement is consistent with the precise determination from Planck 2018 results [1].
