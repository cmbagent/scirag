1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,semi-blind eigen-analysis (often referred to as a principal-component analysis),"**Answer**:

In the Planck 2018 analysis, the standard recombination history is tested using a semi-blind principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of deviations in the free-electron fraction, xe(z), from the standard recombination scenario. This approach expands perturbations in xe(z) across 80 redshift bands, constructs eigenmodes (eXeMs), and fits their amplitudes to the data; the results show no significant evidence for deviations from the standard recombination history, with all mode amplitudes consistent with zero and no impact on cosmological parameters when these modes are included【2:54-56†1807.06209v4.pdf】.

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"In temperature, over half of the small upward shift in A_L is explained by the lower optical depth from the 2018 low-l likelihood, In polarization, the shift in A_L is explained by changes in \tau, with changes in the maps, modelling for beam leakage, and polarization efficiencies.","**Answer**:

The apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily driven by features in the high-ℓ CMB power spectra, where the data show an oscillatory residual that mimics the effect of increased lensing smoothing, leading to a best-fit value of A_L > 1 at about 2–3σ significance. This preference is not seen in the lensing reconstruction data and may be due to statistical fluctuations, analysis choices, or possibly unknown systematics, rather than new physics, as the inclusion of lensing reconstruction pulls A_L back towards unity and reduces the tension with ΛCDM expectations .

10,How are systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses corrected in the Planck analysis?,The X-ray cluster masses errors are corrected by multiplying the true masses by a “hydrostatic mass bias” factor.,"**Answer**:

Systematic errors in X-ray cluster masses in the Planck analysis are corrected by introducing a mass bias parameter (1−b), which accounts for the difference between true cluster masses and those estimated from X-ray observations assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. This bias is calibrated using external weak-lensing and CMB-lensing mass measurements, and the Planck analysis typically adopts a value for (1−b) based on these calibrations, with recent results finding (1−b) = 0.62 ± 0.03, and also referencing updated calibrations such as (1−b) = 0.71 ± 0.10 from CMB-lensing analyses, to correct for systematic underestimation of cluster masses in the cosmological parameter inference.

The main sources of the differences between the ΛCDM parameters in Planck 2015 and 2018 are: (1) the adoption of a new HFI low-ℓ polarization likelihood in 2018, which led to a lower and tighter constraint on the optical depth τ, propagating to shifts in other parameters via degeneracies; and (2) corrections to the high-ℓ polarization spectra in 2018, especially for polarization efficiencies and beam leakage, which further adjusted parameters such as ωb, ωc, and ns.

The high-multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 analysis are constructed using cross-half-mission power spectra of the CMB temperature (TT), temperature-polarization (TE), and polarization (EE) measured at 100, 143, and 217 GHz, with specific multipole cuts applied to each frequency combination to minimize foreground and systematic effects. The main likelihoods used are Plik and CamSpec, which differ slightly in methodology, but both use these spectra in the multipole range ℓ ≥ 30 (with detailed cuts for each spectrum, e.g., 30 ≤ ℓ ≤ 1200 for 100×100, 30 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2000 for 143×143, etc.) and include foreground modeling and calibration corrections as described in the analysis.

21,What differences exist in the cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper?,\Omega_mh^2 differs between the low and high multipole likelihoods at approximately the 2\sigma level,"**Answer**:

The main differences in cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper are that the high-ℓ (ℓ ≥ 802) likelihood pulls parameters towards higher matter density (Ω_m h^2), higher fluctuation amplitude (σ_8), lower scalar spectral index (n_s), and lower H_0 compared to the low-ℓ (ℓ ≤ 801) likelihood, with the difference in Ω_m h^2 being at the 2.8σ level for temperature data and about 2σ when polarization is included. These shifts are correlated and appear consistent with moderate statistical fluctuations, particularly related to the low-ℓ dip in the temperature spectrum and the lensing amplitude at high-ℓ, rather than indicating significant systematics or new physics, and the combined constraints from the full multipole range are consistent with CMB lensing and external data sets.

Unsupervised learning models are used for data generation (generative adversarial networks to generate 2D gas temperature maps), dimensionality reduction (convolutional autoencoders to find lower-dimensional representations of 2D gas maps), and anomaly detection (convolutional autoencoders to find anomalies in 2D gas maps) .

The neural network of CAMELS can predict the evolution of a cosmological quantity such as the star formation rate density (SFRD) with redshift, given cosmological and astrophysical parameters, with an average error of about 0.12 dex (approximately 30% accuracy), which is close to the intrinsic scatter due to cosmic variance (~20%).

The former generates data that has the same properties as the original data and the latter tries to distinguish the difference between the original data and the generated data. This adverserial dynamic produces better data on each iteration.,"**Answer**:

In CAMELS, the architecture of unsupervised generative models, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), forces the model to produce better data on each iteration by pitting two networks—the generator and the discriminator—against each other: as the discriminator improves at distinguishing real from fake images, it forces the generator to create increasingly realistic data to fool the discriminator, thus iteratively improving the quality of generated data.

V_{max}, the maximum circular velocity of a galaxy's subhalo, is important for inferring \Omega_m because it is strongly affected by the dark matter content of galaxies, which in turn depends on \Omega_m.

60,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why does the neural network use V_{max} much more than other properties that are heavily affected by dark matter?","V_{max} contains more information than M_t and \sigma_{\nu}, which are other properties that are expected to be heavily affected by dark matter. The authors believe that is because it is known that V_{max} correlates more strongly with stellar mass than with subhalo mass, thus the value of V_{max} may remain rather stable since it mostly probes the mass in the inner regions of the subhalo, that are the least affected by processes like tidal forces.","**Answer**:

The neural network uses V_{max} much more than other properties affected by dark matter because V_{max} (the maximum circular velocity) is a more stable and direct proxy for the dark matter content and the depth of the gravitational potential well in the central regions of galaxies. Unlike total subhalo mass or velocity dispersion, V_{max} is less affected by processes like tidal stripping, which can remove dark matter from the outskirts of halos without significantly altering the inner potential probed by V_{max}, making it a more robust indicator for inferring cosmological parameters like Ω_m from galaxy properties .

The HST paper identifies several anchor distances for the determination of H_0: NGC 4258 masers, Milky Way (MW) Cepheid parallaxes, LMC detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), and M31 DEBs. However, M31 as an anchor had problems due to the lack of HST F555W data and time-series observations, making it difficult to use the same dereddening procedure as for other anchors, and because its DEB distances are based on early-type stars with significant systematic uncertainties. Therefore, M31 was conservatively excluded from the primary anchor set for H_0 determination, though its inclusion does not significantly change the result and its value is consistent with the other anchors.

According to the ACT DR6 paper, allowing both the electron mass and spatial curvature to vary at recombination does open up degeneracies that permit higher values of H_0, but when late-time data (such as BAO and SNIa) are included, the resulting H_0 values are pulled back toward the standard ΛCDM value, and there is no significant improvement in fit compared to ΛCDM.
