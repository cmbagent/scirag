1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by incorporating subtle atomic physics and radiative-transfer effects using advanced codes like CosmoRec and HyRec. It also performs a semi-blind eigen-analysis of deviations in the free-electron fraction from the standard history and uses non-parametric reconstructions, such as the ModRec model, to parametrize and test for departures in the ionization fraction.

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The apparent preference for A_L > 1 in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily due to a lower optical depth (τ) from the 2018 low-ℓ likelihood, which necessitates a larger A_L to maintain lensing amplitude and smoothing. This preference is also influenced by oscillatory residuals in high-ℓ temperature data, parameter degeneracies, and could be partly due to unknown systematics, foregrounds, statistical fluctuations, or sensitivity to choices made in constructing the likelihoods.

The CAMELS neural network can predict the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) with redshift, given cosmological and astrophysical parameters, achieving an error of approximately 0.12 dex (or 0.106 dex for IllustrisTNG).

100,How do the authors of the ACT DR6 paper model the CMB power spectrum on the very small scales of axion-like particle dynamics?,"**Answer**:

The authors model the CMB power spectrum on very small scales for axion-like particle dynamics using the axionCAMB Boltzmann solver. To accurately capture the power on these small scales and avoid spurious signals, they employ a modified halo model that incorporates mixed dark matter.

101,What would be the signs of dark matter annihilation into SM particles in the CMB power spectra?,"**Answer**:

Dark matter annihilation into Standard Model particles would manifest in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra as damping of high-multipole power in both temperature and polarization, an enhancement of the polarization power spectrum at multipoles less than approximately 400, and shifts in the low-multipole acoustic peaks in polarization. This energy injection alters the ionization history, broadening the last-scattering surface.

102,"In the ACT DR6 paper, why is the constraint for the IDR-IDM model on N_{idr} weaker for the P-ACT-LB dataset than the P-ACT dataset?","**Answer**:

The constraint on N<sub>idr</sub> for the IDR-IDM model is slightly weaker for the P-ACT-LB dataset compared to the P-ACT dataset because of small shifts in the best-fit model parameters when CMB lensing and DESI BAO data are included.

103,"Why does including f\sigma_8 measurements into the calculation of the growth index, associated with a class of modified gravity theories, cause the tension level with GR to increase dramatically?","**Answer**:

Including fσ8 measurements dramatically increases the tension with General Relativity (GR) because these measurements, particularly certain low-redshift data points from redshift-space distortion (RSD) and peculiar velocity surveys, provide tight constraints that pull the growth index (γ) away from the GR prediction of 0.55, while also breaking degeneracies with other cosmological parameters.

104,Do the extensions to \lambdaCDM considered in the ACT DR6 paper help to resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H_0 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement?,"**Answer**:
