1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tested the standard recombination history using a semi-blind eigen-analysis, also known as a principal-component analysis. This method expanded deviations of the free-electron fraction from the standard recombination history into 80 redshift bands, spanning from before helium recombination to after hydrogen recombination.

21,What differences exist in the cosmological parameters between the low and high multipole likelihoods in the Planck 2018 paper?,"**Answer**:

In the Planck 2018 paper, cosmological parameters show shifts between low and high multipole likelihoods. Specifically, the high-multipole temperature data (multipoles $\ell \geq 802$) tend to pull parameters towards higher matter density and fluctuation amplitude, and lower $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $H_{0}$, compared to the lower multipole range. The parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}h^{2}$ differs at the $2.8\sigma$ level for temperature likelihoods, and approximately $2\sigma$ even with the addition of polarization data.

55,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, why are the trained models not robust?","**Answer**:

The trained models are not robust because they fail to accurately infer cosmological parameters when tested on galaxies from a different simulation suite than the one they were trained on. This is attributed to the intrinsic differences in galaxy properties between the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, suggesting the models may be learning features specific to each simulation rather than universal physical relationships.

66,How can the HST retrieve unbiased Cephid photometry data from the model of the Cephid and sources near its vicinity?,"**Answer**:

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) retrieves unbiased Cepheid photometry data by using a scene-modeling approach that builds a model of the Cepheid and nearby sources through the superposition of point-spread functions (PSFs). To correct for sky bias or photometric differences due to blending, artificial stars are added to the scenes, and the mean difference between input and recovered photometry is measured and accounted for.
