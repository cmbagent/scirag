1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by incorporating subtle atomic physics and radiative-transfer effects using advanced codes like CosmoRec and HyRec. It also performs a semi-blind eigen-analysis of deviations in the free-electron fraction from the standard history and uses non-parametric reconstructions, such as the ModRec model, to parametrize and test for departures in the ionization fraction.

8,Why is there an apparent preference for A_L deviating from theoretical expectations in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The apparent preference for A_L > 1 in the Planck 2018 analysis is primarily due to a lower optical depth (τ) from the 2018 low-ℓ likelihood, which necessitates a larger A_L to maintain lensing amplitude and smoothing. This preference is also influenced by oscillatory residuals in high-ℓ temperature data, parameter degeneracies, and could be partly due to unknown systematics, foregrounds, statistical fluctuations, or sensitivity to choices made in constructing the likelihoods.

66,How can the HST retrieve unbiased Cephid photometry data from the model of the Cephid and sources near its vicinity?,"**Answer**:

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) can retrieve unbiased Cepheid photometry data from the scene model by either recalculating the Cepheid photometry using the original mean sky or by correcting the overestimated Cepheid flux based on the measured photometry of artificial stars added to the scenes. The artificial star approach is preferred as it also provides empirical error estimates and an estimate of outlier frequency.

",The f\sigma_8 dataset contains two low-z points with low error bars that lie below the CMB expectation for this dataset. Removing these two points removes the tension between the f\sigma_8 dataset and the P-ACT and W-ACT datasets.,"Including fσ8 measurements dramatically increases the tension with General Relativity (GR) because these measurements, particularly certain low-redshift data points from redshift-space distortion (RSD) and peculiar velocity surveys, provide tight constraints that pull the growth index (γ) away from the GR prediction of 0.55, while also breaking degeneracies with other cosmological parameters.","2503.14454v1.md, Figure 39, 2503.14454v1.md, Section 7.4, 2503.14454v1.md, Section 8.1",5.217751979827881,True,,OpenAI,100,"The generated answer captures the essential idea behind the tension: that low-redshift measurements with low error bars (from RSD and peculiar velocity surveys) tightly constrain the growth index, pulling it away from the GR prediction. This correctly reflects the influence of the two low‐z points described in the ideal answer, so the response aligns well with the ideal answer.",True,,3.6967859268188477
104,Do the extensions to \lambdaCDM considered in the ACT DR6 paper help to resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H_0 and the 2024 SH0ES measurement?,"**Answer**:

No, the extensions to the \(\Lambda\)CDM model considered in the ACT DR6 paper do not help to resolve the tension between the ACT DR6 measurement of H\(_0\) and the 2024 SH0ES measurement. The allowed range for H\(_0\) within these models (66.1 to 71.0 km/s/Mpc) lies below the latest SH0ES measurement, and no class of extensions fully meets the SH0ES bounds.
