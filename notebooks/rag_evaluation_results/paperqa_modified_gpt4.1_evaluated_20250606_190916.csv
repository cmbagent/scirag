1,How is the standard recombination history tested in the Planck 2018 analysis?,"**Answer**:

The Planck 2018 analysis tests the standard recombination history by performing a principal-component (eigenmode) analysis of deviations in the free electron fraction, $x_e(z)$, fitting the amplitudes of these modes to CMB temperature, polarization, lensing, and BAO data; the results show no significant deviations from the standard recombination scenario, confirming its robustness with current data . The analysis also constrains possible non-standard effects, such as energy injection from dark matter annihilation, by quantifying their impact on the ionization history and CMB anisotropies .

35,"In CAMELS, how does the architecture of the unsupervised generative models force the model to produce better data on each iteration?","**Answer**:

In CAMELS, the architecture of unsupervised generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders forces iterative improvement by employing adversarial training—where the generator is penalized when the discriminator correctly identifies fake data, compelling it to produce more realistic outputs—and by using a bottleneck in autoencoders that compresses data, requiring the model to reconstruct images from lower-dimensional representations and thus focus on salient features, with reconstruction error guiding further refinement .

The CAMELS autoencoder, after being trained on temperature maps from a fixed cosmology and astrophysics, was able to reconstruct temperature maps from simulations with very different cosmological and astrophysical parameters with nearly the same accuracy as those it was trained on, which was unexpected given the anticipated morphological differences in the temperature fields . Additionally, when presented with data outside its training distribution (such as the CAMELS logo), the autoencoder exhibited high reconstruction errors on novel features, indicating it had learned a manifold specific to temperature maps rather than a general image compression scheme .

62,"In the ""Cosmology with one galaxy?"" paper, what would be the expected consequences if the authors' conclusions are correct?","**Answer**:

If the authors' conclusions are correct, the internal properties of individual galaxies would encode sufficient information to constrain key cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density parameter Ω_m, making it possible to infer cosmology from single galaxies rather than large samples; this would imply that galaxy properties occupy distinct manifolds in parameter space for different Ω_m values, and that simulations with incorrect Ω_m could not reproduce real galaxy properties . This approach could enable cosmological inference using machine learning on high-dimensional galaxy data, but its robustness depends on the fidelity of simulation subgrid physics .

79,Which anchor distances had problems with being used as anchors in the determination of H_0 in the HST paper?,"**Answer**:

The use of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as an anchor introduced systematic uncertainties due to their shorter mean period and lower metallicity compared to those in spiral galaxies hosting SNe Ia, as well as calibration issues with the WFPC2 camera; additionally, M31 (Andromeda) faced obstacles such as incompatible photometric filters, lack of time-series data, and systematic uncertainties in detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances, making it a less reliable anchor compared to NGC 4258 and the LMC .

M31 is problematic as an anchor for H_0 determination because its Cepheid photometry lacks mean-light F555W-F814W colors for robust dereddening, relies on noisier ground-based colors, and its detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances depend on early-type stars with significant non-LTE model uncertainties, introducing additional systematic errors .

101,What would be the signs of dark matter annihilation into SM particles in the CMB power spectra?,"**Answer**:

Signs of dark matter annihilation into Standard Model particles in the CMB power spectra include increased ionization after recombination, leading to broadening of the last-scattering surface, damping of small-scale (high-ℓ) temperature and polarization anisotropies, enhancement of the polarization power spectrum at low multipoles (ℓ ≲ 400), and distinctive modifications to the acoustic peaks, particularly in polarization for ℓ ≤ 200 .

In the ACT DR6 paper, the constraint on the effective number of interacting dark radiation species, \(N_{\mathrm{idr}}\), is weaker for the P-ACT-LB dataset than for P-ACT because the inclusion of CMB lensing and DESI BAO data introduces small shifts in the best-fit model parameters and parameter degeneracies, which slightly relax the upper limit on \(N_{\mathrm{idr}}\) despite tightening other constraints such as the interaction strength parameter \(\Gamma_{0, \mathrm{nadm}}\) .
